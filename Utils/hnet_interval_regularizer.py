    """
    For all j < task_id, compute the output of the hypernetwork. This output
    will be detached from the graph before being added to the return list of
    this function.

    Note, if these targets don't change during training, it would be more memory
    efficient to store the weights θ* of the hypernetwork (which is a fixed
    amount of memory compared to the variable number of tasks). However, it is
    more computationally expensive to recompute h(c_j, θ*) for all j < task_id
    every time the target is needed.

    Note, this function sets the hypernet temporarily in eval mode. No gradients
    are computed.

    See the argument "targets" of calc_fix_target_reg for a use-case of this
    function.

    Parameters:
    -----------

        task_id (int):
            The ID of the current task.
        hnet:
            An instance of the hypernetwork before learning a new task (i.e.,
            the hypernetwork has the weights θ* necessary to compute the
            targets).
        eps (float):
            A perturbation value.

    Returns:
    --------

        An empty list if task_id is 0. Otherwise, a list of task_id-1 lower,
        middle, and upper targets. These targets can be passed to the function
        calc_fix_target_reg while training on the new task.

    This regularizer restricts the output-mapping for previous task embeddings.

    Parameters:
    ------------

        eps: float
            A perturbation value.
        lower_targets: list, optional
            A list of outputs of the hypernetwork for
            the lower targets. Each list entry must have the output shape as
            returned by the :meth:`hnets.hnet_interface.HyperNetInterface.forward`
            method of the ``hnet``. Note that this function doesn't detach targets.
            If desired, that should be done before calling this function.
        middle_targets: list, optional
            A list of outputs of the hypernetwork for
            the middle targets. Each list entry must have the output shape as
            returned by the :meth:`hnets.hnet_interface.HyperNetInterface.forward`
            method of the ``hnet``.
        upper_targets: list, optional
             A list of outputs of the hypernetwork for
            the upper targets. Each list entry must have the output shape as
            returned by the :meth:`hnets.hnet_interface.HyperNetInterface.forward`
            method of the ``hnet``.
        mnet: 
            Instance of the main network. Has to be provided if
            ``inds_of_out_heads`` are specified.
        prev_theta: list, optional,
            If given, ``prev_task_embs`` but not
            ``targets`` has to be specified. ``prev_theta`` is expected to be
            the internal unconditional weights :math:`\theta` prior to learning
            the current task. Hence, it can be used to compute the targets on
            the fly (which is more memory efficient (constant memory), but more
            computationally demanding).
            The computed targets will be detached from the computational graph.
            Independent of the current hypernet mode, the targets are computed
            in ``eval`` mode.
        prev_task_embs: list, optional
            If given, ``prev_theta`` but not
            ``targets`` has to be specified. ``prev_task_embs`` are the task
            embeddings (conditional parameters) of the hypernetwork.
            See docstring of ``prev_theta`` for more details.

    --------
